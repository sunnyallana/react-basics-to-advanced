1. **Node.js Installation:**
   - In this session, we installed Node.js from its [official website](https://nodejs.org/) to facilitate our work with React.

2. **Project Organization:**
   - We categorized our work with React.js into two main areas: 
     - Working on an existing project 
     - Creating a new project from scratch.

3. **Folder Structure Setup:**
   - Under the existing project category, we created a folder structure:
     - Created a main folder.
     - Inside, we established two subfolders:
       - `public` (for static content).
       - `src` (for dynamic content).

4. **Initialization with `npm init`:**
   - Utilized the command `npm init -y` to initialize a `package.json` file containing project metadata.

5. **Index.html Creation:**
   - Created an `index.html` file within the `public` folder and initialized it with HTML's boilerplate code.

6. **CDN Inclusion for React and React DOM:**
   - Integrated React and React DOM's Content Delivery Network (CDN) links into the `<head>` section of the `index.html` file. These CDNs are available in two variations: production and development.

7. **Babel CDN Integration:**
   - Added Babel's standalone CDN to the `index.html` file to transpile JSX and ensure browser compatibility with React components.

8. **Rendering with ReactDOM:**
   - Explored and distinguished between the traditional and modern approaches to rendering with ReactDOM.
